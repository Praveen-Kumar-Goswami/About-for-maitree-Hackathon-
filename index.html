    <h2>About Maitree</h2>
    <p>
      Maitree is a pioneering rural healthcare app designed to bridge the critical gap 
      between patients and emergency services, especially in underserved and remote areas. 
      As the first of its kind in this segment, Maitree redefines accessibility, improving 
      response time, and ensuring healthcare services are closer to those who need them most.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rural communities, delays in accessing timely healthcare can be life-threatening. 
      Maitree addresses this issue by providing a real-time digital platform that connects 
      patients directly with emergency services such as ambulances and healthcare professionals, 
      minimizing the time it takes for help to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key features include a user-friendly emergency button for drivers, which sends immediate alerts 
      to the nearest healthcare facilities and ambulances. This critical functionality ensures faster 
      response times during high-pressure situations, where every second counts. The app also enables 
      real-time tracking of ambulance locations, giving families peace of mind and better situational awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, Maitree integrates essential healthcare processes like documentation and communication, 
      allowing healthcare providers to receive critical patient information ahead of time. This integration 
      helps reduce errors, confusion, and time delays, ensuring that the medical team is prepared as soon as 
      they arrive on the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maitree’s mission is to bring smarter, more connected healthcare solutions to rural areas, 
      empowering both patients and healthcare providers to respond faster and more effectively. 
      Whether it’s a minor emergency or a life-threatening situation, Maitree is committed to making 
      rural healthcare more accessible, reliable, and efficient.
